    "\n",
    "What are differential equations?  Grant Sanderson from 3Blue1Brown gives us this conceptual description on the origin of differential equations, \"Differential equations arise whenever it is easier to describe change than absolute amounts.\"  The analysis of mechanics of moving bodies, vibrating strings, and heat flow were some of the areas where differential equations were first used.  In this lecture, viscoelasticity will be the topic used to demonstrate the solution to differential equations.  The invention of Calculus and use of the deriviative and integral naturally lead to differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For us, an equation that relates an independent variable (such as time) to some quantities and the derivatives of those quantities with respect to the independent variable is an ordinary differental equation (ODE).  Using x as the independent variable, a general ordinary differential equation looks like this (see Wikipedia page on ODEs):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y^{(n)}=\\sum _{i=0}^{n-1}a_{i}(x)y^{(i)}+r(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $y'$ are the derivatives in the independent variable $x$ and the $a$ could be functions of $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In physics, you have probably solved this differential equation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "m{\\frac {\\mathrm {d} ^{2}x(t)}{\\mathrm {d} t^{2}}}=F(x(t))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where t is now the independent variable.  This is a differential equation restatement of $F= ma$ where it is easier to relate the acceleration and velocity as a differential quantity."
