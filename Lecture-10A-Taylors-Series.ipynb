    "It is common in physics and engineering to represent transcendental functions and other nonlinear expressions using a few terms from a Taylor series.  This series provides a fast and efficient way to compute quantities such as $\\mathrm{sin}(x)$ or $e^x$ to a prescribed error.  Learning how to calculate the series representation of these functions will provide practical experience with the Taylor series and help the student understand the results of Python methods designed to accelerate and simplify computations.  The series can be written generally as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = f{\\left (0 \\right )} + x \\left. \\frac{d}{d x} f{\\left (x \\right )} \\right|_{\\substack{ x=0 }} + \\frac{x^{2}}{2} \\left. \\frac{d^{2}}{d x^{2}}  f{\\left (x \\right )} \\right|_{\\substack{ x=0 }} + \\frac{x^{3}}{6} \\left. \\frac{d^{3}}{d x^{3}}  f{\\left (x \\right )} \\right|_{\\substack{ x=0 }} + \\frac{x^{4}}{24} \\left. \\frac{d^{4}}{d x^{4}}  f{\\left (x \\right )} \\right|_{\\substack{ x=0 }} + \\frac{x^{5}}{120} \\left. \\frac{d^{5}}{d x^{5}}  f{\\left (x \\right )} \\right|_{\\substack{ x=0 }} + \\mathcal{O}\\left(x^{6}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Of equal importance the Taylor series permits discrete representation of derivatives and is a common way to perform numerical integration of partial and ordinary differential equations.  Expansion of a general function $f(x)$ about a point, coupled with algebraic manipulation, will produce expressions that can be used to approximate derivative quantities.  Although any order of derivative can be computed, this lesson will focus on first and second derivatives that will be encountered in the diffusion equation."

From that point you will more easily see the strategy you should use to write vectorized code.  \n",
